You are appointed as a Software/DevOps Engineer in ABC media services.
On your first day you need to troubleshoot a problem. There is a command “xyz”
somewhere installed in that linux system. But as a new joinee you do not have any
idea about where is that Installed. How can you check that?

Solution: which and whichis command.
Example:

ttn@animesh-deepak:tmp $ which ls
/bin/ls

ttn@animesh-deepak:tmp $ whereis ls
ls: /bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz
ttn@animesh-deepak:tmp $
